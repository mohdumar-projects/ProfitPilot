# ProfitPilot
   <h4>Overview</h4>

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict airline profitability based on various operational and financial factors. The goal is to create a robust and interpretable model that aids airline operators in optimizing decision-making and maximizing profitability.


  <h4>Problem Statement</h4>

In the airline industry, maximizing profitability is a complex challenge influenced by multiple operational and financial factors. Given historical flight performance data, this project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts profit (USD) for each flight based on features such as:

  * Flight delays

  * Aircraft utilization

  * Turnaround time

  * Load factor

  * Fleet availability

  * Maintenance downtime

  * Fuel efficiency

  * Revenue

  * Operating costs

<h4>Model Requirements</h4>

The model must be robust enough to handle real-world uncertainties, including:

  * Seasonal fluctuations

  * Operational inefficiencies

  * Cost variations

Additionally, the model should provide explainability to help airline operators understand the key drivers of profitability and optimize decision-making.

  <h4>Key Features</h4>

  * Data preprocessing and feature engineering

  * Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations

  * Machine learning model training and evaluation

  * Interpretability techniques for model explainability

  * Handling real-world uncertainties and generalization to unseen data

  <h4>Technologies Used</h4>

  * Python

  * Jupyter Notebook

  * Pandas

  * NumPy

  * Scikit-learn

  * Matplotlib

  * SHAP (for model explainability)

  * Seaborn

  * Joblib

<h4>Code Explanation</h4>

1. Data Loading & Exploration

  * The dataset is loaded using Pandas, and initial exploratory analysis is performed to understand the structure, missing values, and key statistics.

  * Visualizations include histograms and boxplots to analyze distributions and detect outliers.

2. Data Cleaning

  * Handles missing values and converts date/time columns appropriately.

  * Outliers are managed using winsorization to avoid extreme values impacting model training.

  * Duplicate records are removed to ensure data integrity.

3. Feature Engineering

  * Creates interaction and ratio-based features such as Revenue_Load_Factor and Operating_Cost_Ratio.

  * Extracts cyclical features from Scheduled Departure Time to capture seasonal trends.

4. Model Training & Evaluation

  * Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.

  * Implements multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

  * Evaluates models based on Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared values.

  * Uses GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

5. Model Explainability

  * SHAP values are used to interpret feature importance and model decision-making.

  * Visual explanations help understand key profitability drivers.
